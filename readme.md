# Internal cvelist.

This is the internal cvelist repository for managing [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org) ids allocated to the [Atlassian](http://go.atlassian.com/cna) [CNA](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html#cna_participants).


### Setup

Install the needed dependencies by running

    pip install -r requirements.txt


### Adding new CVE ranges

1. create a new git branch, e.g. `git checkout -b <adding-cve-id-range-2018-01-31>`
2. modify [`cve_id_ranges.json`](cve_id_ranges.json) to specify the new range(s).
3. run `python validator.py`
4. raise a pull request to get the changes merged.

### Reserving a CVE id

1. run `git remote update`
2. run `python -m scripts.reserve_a_cve_id <year that the issue was discovered in>`
3. modify the cve id file that the script has allocated by:
 1. providing the name of the product as the value for `product_name`, for example `Bamboo`.
 2. providing affected version information in `version_data` `version_value`(s).
 3. providing at least one url in `reference_data` section containing the issue(s) you want to detail.
 4. provide information on the problem type under `problemtype`, for example `Cross Site Scripting (XSS)`.
 5. provide a description under `description_data` that conforms with the [CNA rules](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/CNA_Rules_v2.0.pdf) (see appendix B).
4. run `python validator.py`
5. raise a pull request to get the changes merged.


### Syncing with the public cvelist

**First** you need to clone the [public cvelist repository](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist) onto your machine.

Then you can use the `scripts/sync_with_public_cvelist.py` script to synchronize between the internal cvelist and the public one.
Information on using the sync script can be obtained by running

    python -m scripts.sync_with_public_cvelist -h
