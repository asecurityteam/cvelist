A remote attacker with write permission on a repository can write to any arbitrary file (they have write permission to) to the victim's Bitbucket Server instance using the edit-file endpoint. In some cases, this can result in execution of arbitrary code by the victim's Bitbucket Server instance. Fixed versions are 5.16.11 and above.
