A remote attacker with user level permissions can exploit this vulnerability by executing the commands entered on the Project Name and Description fields on the victim's system. This could result in disclosing sensitive information such as the victim's env files. The attacker needs to have permission to create projects on the victim's Bitbucket Server instance. Vulnerability exists when trying to create a repository within a project for the second time, with the same Project Name and Description as mentioned the first time.
